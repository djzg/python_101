The first and second numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are both 1. 
After that, each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. 
The first several numbers in the sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... 
Write a Python function called fibonacci(number) that takes a positive integer parameter and returns the number at that position of the Fibonacci sequence. 
For example fib(1) = 1, fib(3) = 2, fib(5) = 5, etc. 
Your function does not need to print anything out - just return a value.

For example, your function could be use as such:
```
term = fibonacci(17)
```

You cannot use recursion, since we haven't covered that technique.  That means that for this assignment you cannot have your function call itself.

The file should be named fibonacci.py
