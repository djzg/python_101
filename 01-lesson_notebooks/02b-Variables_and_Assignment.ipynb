    "## Static Typing vs. Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can change from type to type with any new assignment. For example, this is a legal statement in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_number = 57`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_number = 'fifty-seven'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing can make for an easy introduction to programming, but can be quite problematic as your codebase gets more and more complex and ever changing variables are harder to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you keep your variables straight, you can use the `type` function to see what type of value a variable currently refers to. See example below\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Extra note*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For this exact reason, many popular languages use a system called static typing, whereby a variable type must be intially defined and cannot change without a properly defined operation. Python has added some capability to approximate static typing in later versions (while under the hood still not technically being static typing). This functionaltiy in Python will not be specifically covered in this iteration of this course, but it's worth understanding as it is commonly implemented among development teams that use Python.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Static typing in C++, for example, would look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int myNumber = 57;`\n",
