# project-05a

Write a **recursive** Python function named multiply that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns the product of those two numbers. 
Your program can not use multiplication - it has to use addition to find the result.  To get your thinking on the right track:
```
7 * 4 = 7 + (7 * 3)
7 * 3 = 7 + (7 * 2)
7 * 2 = 7 + (7 * 1)
7 * 1 = 7
So, 7 * 4 = 7 + (7 + (7 + (7)))
```

Your function cannot use loop

The file should be named: multiply_recur.py
