# project-06b

Write a Python function named add_surname that takes a list of first names as parameter and return a list that contains only those names that start with a "K", but with the surname "Hoffman" added to each one, with a space between the first and last names.  
You may assume that all names in the list begin with a capital letter. 
For example, if the original list is:
```
["Kiki", "Krystal", "Pavel", "MaryKay", "Annie", "Koala"]
```
Then the list that is returned should be:
```
['Kiki Hoffman', 'Krystal Hoffman', 'Koala Hoffman']
```
The file should be named: add_surname.py
