**Remember that, as stated in the Code Style Guidelines, all functions in all assignments must have a docstring.**

Use  the following formula to determine the distance an objects  falls in  an amount of time due to gravity

d = (1/2)gt<sup>2</sup>

where d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the time in seconds. 
Write a Python function called distance_fallen() that takes time (in second) as an argument then calculates the distance the object has fallen during that time using the formula above.

Here's a simple example of how your distance_fallen() function could be used:
```
dist = distance_fallen(4.5)
print(dist)
```

The file should be named: distance_fallen.py
