# project-03c

Write a Python program that takes in an integer that a player will attempt to guess. The program should display "too high" if the guess is higher and "too lower" if the guess is lower. The program will not stop unless the player guesses the correct integer and print out the number of guesses the player took. The program should executed as follow:

Enter the number for the player to guess.
-10
Enter your guess.
10
Too high - try again:
5
Too high - try again:
-200
Too low - try again:
-10
You guessed it in 4 tries.
```
If the user guesses the number in 1 try, then your program should print "You guessed it in 1 try."

The file should be named: guess_num.py
