Write a Python function named find_median that takes a list of number as argument and return the median of those numbers.
You will need to sort the list in order to find the median. Please look up on how to find median if you're not familiar with the logic

For example, it could be used like this:
```
list_of_nums = [13,7,-3,82,4]
result = find_median(list_of_nums)
```

The file should be named: find_median.py
