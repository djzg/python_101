    "# Tools and Setup\n",
    "Here's we're going to downlaod all the tools I'd recommend to use this course. If, you ever ask yourself \"why am I download things?\", Checkout the next lesson [01b-Some_Context](01b-Some_Context.ipynb) for fairly comprehensive definitions of all the tools we're downloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials and Installation\n",
    "In order to properly use the materials in the course, there are a number of tools and software you need to download.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test to see that you have python. Open your terminal on Mac or Linux or CMD on Windows and try the commands `python3 --version` or `python --version` and see if you have python already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have it then **Download and install the current version of Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download with all the default features. If you're installing on Windows, I suggest you select the option on the first page in the download wizard to \"Add Python ## to PATH\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download the Microsoft's VS Codium IDE [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**\n",
    "/*If you want to fight the power, you can dowload VS Codium, essentially open source VS Code without the Windows [here](https://vscodium.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download and install Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test for python and git bash on Windows\n",
    "If you're using Windows, you can open up the command prompt from the start menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `python` and the `enter` key in the CMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's check for git bash. Git bash is terminal that will give us access to Unix like commands, similar to commands that are used on Linux and Mac. It's a mucher cleaner terminals than Windows CMD, which has lots of subtle differences that are a pain to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to check that our new git bash works is to right click ona folder, we should se the option of `Git bash here`. If you see that, then you're in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test for python on Mac \n",
    "Open up your terminal and type in the command `python3` and the `return` key. You will likely need to type in `python3` as the legacy version of python on your Mac is likely Python 2 which comes pre-installed on most Macs and by default uses the command `python`. This is important to keep in mind down the road when you are needing to install things with the correct version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup a github account\n",
    "Got to https://github.com/ and create an account\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup your local git global settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to [Earth Lab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/fork-clone-github-repositories/) for their comprehensive version control setup instructions. A summary of setup from them is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time that you use git on a computer, you will need to configure your GitHub.com username and email address. This information will be used to document who made changes to files in git. It is important to use the same email address and username that you setup on GitHub.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set your Github.com username in the terminal by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git config --global user.name \"username\".`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can set the email for your Github.com account by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git config --global user.email \"email@email.com\".`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `--global` configuration option, you are telling git to use these settings for all git repositories that you work with on your computer. Note that you only have to configure these settings one time on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check your config settings for `user.name` and `user.email` using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config user.name` which returns the username that you set previously\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config user.email` which returns the email that you set previously\n",
    "\n",
    "These configuration settings ensure that changes you make to repositories are attributed to your username and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend you try also try Earth Lab's steps on setting up an SSH connection to  Github. This will be very useful to you on your development journey. Find those instructions [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/how-to-setup-git/) (you will need to scroll down the page).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fork the class materials\n",
    "From this project's main repository: https://github.com/branhoff/python_class_101.git, select the \"fork\" option to create a copy of this project under your GitHub profile. The directory for this forked repository will be the equivalent of `https://github.com/[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create projects directory\n",
    "Create  directory on your machine where you want to house future projects you want to save in GitHub (generally programming projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal you can type `cd ~` to go to your \"home directory\". I advise you create a directory called \"GitProjects\" or \"Projcets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do that from the command line by typing `mkdir GitProjects`. If you type `ls` on the command line you should see the directory you created listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also type `pwd` (present working directory) to see where you've created your project if you're not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or naturally, create all this manually through your computer's standard interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone the class materials\n",
    "The latest materials are saved at github at this location: https://github.com/branhoff/python_class_101\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's clone from the forked directory you made. We can easily access them by using the `git clone https://github.com/[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed the steps for setting up `ssh` keys for github (which I do recommend), you'll use a command like `git clone git@github.com:[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning for Windows\n",
    "In the directory you created to house git related projects (I like the name GitProjects), right click on your created directory, and select your `Git bash here` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "A git bash window will open up at the file location. Now simply type in the command `git clone https://github.com/[your.user.name]]/python_class_101.git` or `git clone git@github.com:[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git` if you used ssh.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see in your created directory a new directory called `python_class_101` with all of the material for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning for Mac\n",
    "Navigate to the directory you created to house git related projects (I like the name GitProjects) from your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now simply type in the command `git clone https://github.com/[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git` or `git clone git@github.com:[your.user.name]/python_class_101.git` if you set up ssh.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see in that directory a new directory called `python_class_101` with all of the material for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Jupyter Notebook for Windows\n",
    "We can use python's `pip` (Python Package Index) to install libraries and dependencies that don't come included with Python's standard library. In our case, we need the open-source tool Jupyter Notebook (introduced in *01b-Some_Context*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up your Git Bash window and type the command `pip install jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test you can access Jupyter Notebooks on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Test that it works by right clicking on the `python_class_101` directory you cloned from github earlier and launch your Git Bash Window here. Now your gitbash window should have the file path of your `python_class_101` directory displayed. Type the command `jupyter notebook` and you should see a browser window launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Jupyter Notebook for Mac\n",
    "We can use python's `pip` (Python Package Index) to install libraries and dependencies that don't come included with Python's standard library. In our case, we need the open-source tool Jupyter Notebook (introduced in *01b-Some_Context*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up your Git Bash window and type the command `pip3 install jupyter`. If your Mac is pre M1, then Python 2 is likely already installed on your Mac and the normal `pip` command is aliased to Python 2's version of pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test you can access Jupyter Notebooks on Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to your file path of your `python_class_101`. Type the command `jupyter notebook` and you should see a browser window launch with the materials displayed there."
