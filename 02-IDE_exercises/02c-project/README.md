# project-02c

Write a Python program that prompts the user for a (integer) number of cents, from 0 to 99, and calculates the least number of coins required to make change.  When your program is executed, it should match the following format:
```
Please enter an amount between 0 and 99 cents.
87
Your change will be:
Q: 3
D: 1
N: 0
P: 2
```
Hint: You may find the mod operator (%)  useful.
* 1 quarter = 25 cents
* 1 dime = 10 cents
* 1 nickel = 5 cents
* 1 penny = 1 cent

The file must be named: coin_change.py
