# project-07b

Write a Python function named reverse_list that takes a list of number as parameter and reverses the order of the elements in that list. 
It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list and your function must not use any slicing.

Your function could be used like this:
```
vals = [2, -5, 10, 9]
reverse_list(vals)
print(vals)  # This should print [9, 10, -5, 2]
```

The file should be named: reverse_list.py
