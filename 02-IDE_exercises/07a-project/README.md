# project-07a

Write a Python function called square_list that takes a list of numbers as parameter and replaces each value with the square of that value. 
It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list.

Your function could be used like this:
```
nums = [7, -3, 12, 9]
square_list(nums)
print(nums)  # This should print [49, 9, 144, 81]
```

The file should be named: square_list.py
