Write a Python program to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the following fomular:

F = (9/5)C + 32

where F is Fahrenheit and C is Celsius. The program should take an input from the user in 
Celsius and outputs the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. When you run your program, it should match the following format:

```
Please enter the temperature in Celsius.
34.5
The corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit is:
94.1
```
Your result only needs to match to 7 decimal places and does not to be exact. For example, 13.0999999999 is considered correct.

The file should be named: temp_conversion.py
