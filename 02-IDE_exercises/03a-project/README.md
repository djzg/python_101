# project-03a

Write a Python program that asks the users how many number they would like to enter, where the users need to enter at least one number, and then prompt the user to enter that many numbers. Once the user has entered all the numbers, the program should output the largest and smallest of those numbers
(You are not permitted to use any data structures or any materials we have not covered). The program should follow this format when it is executed:
```
How many numbers would you like to enter?
3
Please enter 3 numbers.
3
5
7

min: 3
max: 7
```
Hints: How many numbers do you have to keep track at a time? 
If someone were reading a list of numbers to you, and you had to tell them the max and min at the end, how would you do it? 
How should you initialize your variables?  What happens if the user only enters one integer?

The file must be named: min_max_number.py
