For example, you can have **num_1** referencing an object with the value 7, and **num_2** referencing a different object with the value 7. It's not possible to have variables refer to the same object, but not be equal. For example, if **num_1** and **num_2** both reference the same object that has a value of -3, then **num_1** and **num_2** will be equal."
